# GitHub-Noops
I will try to create something interesting using every single Noop there is!
One of the challenges I have set myself is to try and keep every piece of code in vanilla Python (EXCLUDING REQUESTS), i.e You will not need to install any libraries, just python. 

<h2><a href="https://noopschallenge.com/challenges/hexbot">Hexbot</a></h2>
A simple color sorter with a couple effects

<h2><a href="https://noopschallenge.com/challenges/vexbot">Vexbot</a></h2>
A point and line renderer in the console

<h2><a href="https://noopschallenge.com/challenges/directbot">Directbot</a></h2>
A particle system in the console

<h2><a href="https://noopschallenge.com/challenges/mazebot">Mazebot</a></h2>
A very simple console maze game, currently works on windows only.

<h2><a href="https://noopschallenge.com/challenges/polybot">Polybot</a></h2>
Struggled to think of something interesting so I created a very simple shape viewer in the console

<h2><a href="https://noopschallenge.com/challenges/golfbot">Golfbot</a></h2>
 - <strong>10 Print challenge</strong>
   managed to complete the challenge with only 78 characters and only on one line, kinda, using python 3.8<br>
 - <strong>Hexcode Generator challenge</strong>
   managed to complete the challenge using only 102 characters  
   
<h2><a href="https://noopschallenge.com/challenges/wordbot">Wordbot</a></h2>
A command line sentance builder that allows you to build up a sentance using the random words given by the wordbot

I may have skipped a couple, this would be because I either don't find them interesting. I have also skipped all of the quiz-style Noops as I believe they are mainly aimed at the developer to do on their own.

If there will be any new Noops I will surely have a go at using them too!
